We're implementing the pair-review project. The requirements and agent team are defined in CLAUDE.md. Please:

  1. Initialize git if not already done
  2. Start with Phase 1 from PLAN.md (Foundation)
  3. Use the agent team approach - Task the PM for detailed requirements, then Engineer to implement, then QA to verify
  4. Study prior art before implementation (especially local-review for UI)
  5. Commit working code after QA passes each feature
  6. Track progress in PLAN.md as you go

  Begin by reviewing CLAUDE.md and PLAN.md, then start the implementation process.
