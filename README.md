## What is pair-review?

pair-review is a local web application that transforms how you review code, especially code generated by AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and others. It helps you provide structured feedback and ensures quality through human oversight.

### Two Core Value Propositions

1. **Tight Feedback Loop for AI Coding Agents**
   - Review AI-generated code with clarity and precision
   - Provide structured feedback in markdown format
   - Copy and paste feedback directly back to your coding agent
   - Create a continuous improvement cycle where you stay in control

2. **AI-Assisted Human Review Partner**
   - Get AI-powered suggestions to accelerate your reviews
   - Highlight potential issues and noteworthy code patterns
   - You make the final decisions - adopt, edit, or discard AI suggestions
   - Add your own comments alongside AI insights

## Why pair-review?

- **Local-First**: All data and processing happens on your machine - no cloud dependencies
- **GitHub-Familiar UI**: Interface feels instantly familiar to GitHub users
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI suggests, you decide
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for Claude, Gemini, Codex, Copilot, and OpenCode. Use your existing subscription!
- **Progressive**: Start simple with manual review, add AI analysis when you need it

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Option 1: No installation required (npx)**

```bash
npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review <PR-number-or-URL or --local>
```

**Option 2: Global install**

```bash
npm install -g @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review
pair-review <PR-number-or-URL>
```

> **Tip:** Create an alias for frequent use:
> ```bash
> alias pr='npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review'
> ```

Either way, pair-review will:
1. Check out the PR branch locally (using git worktrees)
2. Open the web UI in your browser
3. Show you a familiar diff view

> **Note:** The examples below use the shorter `pair-review` command. If you're using npx without a global install, substitute `npx @in-the-loop-labs/pair-review` instead.

### Review a Pull Request

```bash
# By PR number (in a GitHub repo)
pair-review 123

# By full GitHub URL
pair-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Review local uncommitted changes
pair-review --local
```

### Basic Workflow

1. **Review the diff** - See all file changes in a familiar GitHub-like interface
2. **Optional: Trigger AI analysis** - Get 3-level AI review insights:
   - Level 1: Issues in changed lines only
   - Level 2: Consistency within file context
   - Level 3: Architectural consistency across codebase
3. **Add comments** - Adopt AI suggestions or write your own
4. **Export feedback** - Copy as markdown to paste back to your coding agent
5. **Submit review** - Post to GitHub with approval status (or keep it local)

## Command Line Interface

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Review a pull request by number
pair-review <PR-number>

# Review a pull request by URL
pair-review <PR-URL>

# Review local uncommitted changes in the current directory or a specified path
pair-review --local [path]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<PR-number>` | PR number to review (requires being in a GitHub repo) |
| `<PR-URL>` | Full GitHub PR URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`) |
| `--ai` | Automatically run AI analysis when the review loads |
| `--ai-draft` | Run AI analysis and save suggestions as a draft review on GitHub |
| `--configure` | Show setup instructions and configuration options |
| `-d`, `--debug` | Enable verbose debug logging for troubleshooting |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help message with full CLI documentation |
| `-l`, `--local [path]` | Review local uncommitted changes. Optional path defaults to current directory |
| `--model <name>` | Override the AI model for any provider. Model availability depends on provider configuration. |
| `-v`, `--version` | Show version number |

### Examples

```bash
pair-review 123                        # Review PR #123 in current repo
pair-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456
pair-review --local                    # Review uncommitted local changes
pair-review 123 --ai                   # Auto-run AI analysis
```

## Configuration

On first run, pair-review will prompt you to configure the application.

**Token Requirements:**
- **Local mode** (`--local`): Works without a GitHub token - no configuration needed
- **PR review mode**: Requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to fetch PR data and submit reviews

Configuration is stored in `~/.pair-review/config.json`:

```json
{
  "github_token": "ghp_your_token_here",
  "port": 3000,
  "theme": "light",
  "default_provider": "claude",
  "default_model": "sonnet"
}
```

On first run, pair-review creates `~/.pair-review/config.example.json` with comprehensive examples of all available options, including custom provider and model configurations. Use this as a reference when customizing your setup.

For advanced configuration with custom providers and models, see [AI Provider Configuration](#ai-provider-configuration) below.

### Environment Variables

pair-review supports several environment variables for customizing behavior:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Personal Access Token (takes precedence over config file) | - |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_CLAUDE_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Claude CLI | `claude` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_GEMINI_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Gemini CLI | `gemini` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_CODEX_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Codex CLI | `codex` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_COPILOT_CMD` | Custom command to invoke Copilot CLI | `copilot` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_OPENCODE_CMD` | Custom command to invoke OpenCode CLI | `opencode` |
| `PAIR_REVIEW_MODEL` | Override the AI model to use (same as `--model` flag) | Provider default |

**Note:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` is the standard environment variable used by many GitHub tools (gh CLI, GitHub Actions, etc.). When set, it takes precedence over the `github_token` field in the config file.

**Note:** The `--model` CLI flag is shorthand for setting `PAIR_REVIEW_MODEL`. If both are specified, the CLI flag takes precedence.

These variables are useful when:
- Your CLI tools are installed in a non-standard location
- You need to use a wrapper script or custom binary
- You want to force a specific model for all reviews

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use GitHub token from environment variable (CI/CD friendly)
GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxx" pair-review 123

# Use a custom path for Claude CLI
PAIR_REVIEW_CLAUDE_CMD="/usr/local/bin/claude" pair-review 123

# Use a wrapper command (supports multi-word commands)
PAIR_REVIEW_CLAUDE_CMD="devx claude" pair-review 123

# Use Gemini with npx
PAIR_REVIEW_GEMINI_CMD="npx gemini" pair-review --local

# Force a specific model for this review
PAIR_REVIEW_MODEL="opus" pair-review 123

# Combine multiple settings
PAIR_REVIEW_CLAUDE_CMD="/opt/claude/bin/claude" PAIR_REVIEW_MODEL="haiku" pair-review 123
```

**Note:** Multi-word commands (containing spaces) are supported. The application automatically handles these by using shell mode for execution.

### GitHub Token

Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with these scopes:
- `repo` (full control of private repositories)
- `read:org` (if reviewing organization repos)

[Create token on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

### AI Provider Configuration

pair-review integrates with AI providers via their CLI tools:

- **Claude**: Uses Claude Code CLI
- **Gemini**: Uses Gemini CLI
- **Codex**: Uses Codex CLI
- **GitHub Copilot**: Uses Copilot CLI
- **OpenCode**: Uses OpenCode CLI (requires model configuration)

You can select your preferred provider and model in the repository settings UI.

#### Built-in vs. Configurable Providers

Most providers (Claude, Gemini, Codex, Copilot) come with built-in model definitions. **OpenCode is different** - it has no built-in models and requires you to configure which models to use.

#### Configuring Custom Models

You can override provider settings and define custom models in your config file. This is useful for:
- Adding models to OpenCode (required)
- Overriding default commands or arguments
- Setting provider-specific environment variables

**Full provider configuration example:**

```json
{
  "github_token": "ghp_your_token_here",
  "default_provider": "opencode",
  "default_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
  "providers": {
    "opencode": {
      "command": "opencode",
      "extra_args": ["--verbose"],
      "env": { "OPENCODE_TELEMETRY": "off" },
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
          "tier": "balanced",
          "default": true,
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4",
          "description": "Fast and capable for most reviews",
          "tagline": "Best balance of speed and quality"
        },
        {
          "id": "anthropic/claude-opus-4",
          "tier": "premium",
          "name": "Claude Opus 4",
          "description": "Most capable model for complex reviews"
        },
        {
          "id": "openai/gpt-4.1",
          "tier": "thorough",
          "name": "GPT-4.1",
          "description": "OpenAI's latest model"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Provider Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `command` | CLI command to execute (overrides default and environment variable) |
| `extra_args` | Additional arguments to pass to the CLI |
| `env` | Environment variables to set when running the CLI |
| `installInstructions` | Custom installation instructions shown in UI |
| `models` | Array of model definitions (see below) |

#### Model Configuration Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Model identifier passed to the CLI |
| `tier` | Yes | One of: `fast`, `balanced`, `thorough` (aliases: `free`→`fast`, `premium`→`thorough`) |
| `name` | No | Display name in the UI |
| `description` | No | Longer description of the model |
| `tagline` | No | Short description shown in model picker |
| `badge` | No | Badge text (e.g., "NEW", "BETA") |
| `badgeClass` | No | CSS class for badge styling |
| `default` | No | Set to `true` to make this the default model for the provider |
| `extra_args` | No | Model-specific CLI arguments |
| `env` | No | Model-specific environment variables |

#### Model Tiers

Models are grouped by tier to help users choose appropriately:

- **fast**: Quick analysis, lower cost, good for simple reviews
- **balanced**: Best mix of speed and quality (recommended)
- **thorough**: Most comprehensive analysis, higher cost

Aliases are available for convenience: `free` (maps to `fast`), `premium` (maps to `thorough`).

#### Command Precedence

The CLI command used for a provider follows this precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Environment variable (e.g., `PAIR_REVIEW_OPENCODE_CMD`)
2. Config file `providers.<provider>.command`
3. Built-in default

#### Migration Notes

If you have an older config file using `provider` and `model` keys at the top level, they are automatically treated as `default_provider` and `default_model`. No migration is required.

## Features

### Three-Level AI Analysis

pair-review's AI analysis system examines your code changes at increasing levels of context:

- **Level 1 - Isolation**: Analyzes only the changed lines for bugs and issues
- **Level 2 - File Context**: Checks consistency within the entire file
- **Level 3 - Codebase Context**: Validates architectural patterns across the codebase

This progressive approach keeps analysis focused while catching issues at every scope.

### Review Feedback Export

The killer feature for AI coding agent workflows:

1. Add comments during your review (manual or AI-assisted)
2. Click "Preview Review" to see formatted markdown
3. Copy the markdown
4. Paste into your coding agent's chat
5. Agent iterates based on your feedback

The markdown includes file paths, line numbers, and your comments - everything the agent needs to understand and act on your feedback.

### Inline Comments

- Add comments directly on specific lines
- See all comments in context with the diff
- Edit or discard AI suggestions before finalizing
- Comments include file and line number for precision

### Local Mode

Review **unstaged**, uncommitted changes before creating a PR:

```bash
pair-review --local
```

Perfect for:
- Self-review before committing
- Getting AI feedback on work-in-progress
- Iterating with a coding agent on local changes
- Reviewing only the unstaged files that are still changing
- Staging the files you've already reviewed and viewing the next round of changes

4. Catch issues early
5. Commit with confidence

## FAQ

**Q: Does my code get sent to the cloud?**
A: Not by pair-review. Pair-review keeps all its data locally. AI providers that you use for review may communicate with their servers.

**Q: Do I need to use AI analysis?**
A: No. pair-review works great as a local review UI without AI. Trigger analysis only when you want it.

**Q: Which AI provider should I use?**
A: Any that you have configured locally. Claude excels at code review, but try different providers to see what works best for you.

**Q: Can I use this for non-GitHub repos?**
A: Local mode (`--local`) works with any git repository. PR review mode requires GitHub.

**Q: How do I give feedback to a coding agent?**
A: Add comments during review, click "Preview Review", copy the markdown, and paste it into your coding agent's chat interface.

**Q: Something isn't working right. What should I try first?**
A: Try refreshing your browser. Many transient issues resolve with a simple page refresh.

**Q: How do I use OpenCode as my AI provider?**
A: OpenCode has no built-in models, so you must configure them in your `~/.pair-review/config.json`. Add a `providers.opencode.models` array with at least one model definition. See the [AI Provider Configuration](#ai-provider-configuration) section for a complete example.
