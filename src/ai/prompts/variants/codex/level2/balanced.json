Evaluate changes against the file’s existing structure and patterns\n4. Check for consistency, missing related changes, and file-wide impact\n5. Skip the file if no file-level issues are found",
      "focus-areas": "## Focus Areas\nLook for:\n- In-file inconsistencies (naming, patterns, error handling)\n- Missing companion changes within the same file\n- File-context security risks\n- Style or pattern deviations\n- Design pattern alignment within the file\n- Documentation gaps for file-level changes\n- Noteworthy positives worth praising",
      "available-commands": "## Available Commands (READ-ONLY)\n- git-diff-lines (preferred for line-numbered changes)\n- `cat -n <file>` to view files with line numbers\n- rg, grep, find, ls as needed\n\nDo NOT modify files. Analysis and reporting only.\nParallel read-only tasks are allowed.",
      "diff-instructions": "## Line Number Reference (old_or_new field)\n- Use **\"NEW\"** for ADDED [+] lines and CONTEXT lines (default)\n- Use **\"OLD\"** ONLY for DELETED [-] lines\n\nContext lines exist in both files; always label them \"NEW\".\nWhen unsure, use \"NEW\".",
      "file-level-guidance": "## Line-Level vs File-Level Suggestions\nPrefer line-level comments when you can anchor to specific lines. Use file-level suggestions only for true file-wide observations.\n\nAppropriate file-level topics:\n- File architecture or organization\n- Module naming conventions\n- Missing tests for the file\n- File structure improvements\n- Module-level design patterns\n\nFile-level suggestions must NOT include a line number.",
      "guidelines": "## Guidelines\n\n**Priority:**\n1. Skip files with no file-level issues\n2. Anchor suggestions to specific lines when possible\n3. Use fileLevelSuggestions only for file-wide concerns\n4. Focus on issues that require full file context\n\n**Output rules:**\n- For \"praise\": omit the suggestion field\n- For other types: include specific, actionable suggestions\n\n**Confidence:**\n- 0.8–1.0: clear, confident issues\n- 0.5–0.79: likely but some uncertainty\n- <0.5: omit unless critical"
