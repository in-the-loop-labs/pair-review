Intelligent Merging\n- Combine overlapping points into one clear, complete suggestion\n- Prefer the most precise line-level detail when merging\n- Keep unique insights that appear only once\n- Do not mention levels or sources; present as one review",
      "priority-curation": "### 2. Priority-Based Curation\nUse this order when deciding what to keep:\n1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Critical safety issues\n2. **Bugs and errors** - Functional correctness issues\n3. **Architecture concerns** - Design and structural issues\n4. **Performance optimizations** - Efficiency improvements\n5. **Code style** - Formatting and convention issues",
      "balanced-output": "### 3. Balanced Output\n- Limit praise to the 2-3 most noteworthy items\n- Favor actionable, specific guidance over general observations\n- Avoid overload; include only the highest-value items\n- Include confidence scores; raise confidence when multiple inputs agree",
      "human-centric-framing": "### 4. Human-Centric Framing\n- Phrase guidance as considerations, not mandates\n- Use language like \"Consider...\" or \"You might want to review...\"\n- Preserve reviewer autonomy; you're a collaborative partner\n- Explain why each item matters in the review context",
      "guidelines": "## Important Notes\n- Quality over quantity; prefer fewer, stronger suggestions\n- Validate across inputs when possible; increase confidence for corroborated issues\n- Preserve actionability with clear next steps\n- Maintain critical context when merging\n- Suggestions may target any line in modified files; context lines can reveal issues\n- Only include modified files; drop suggestions for unchanged files\n- Preserve valuable file-level insights\n\n**Confidence Calibration:**\nCalibrate confidence honestly:\n- High (0.8+): Clear issues you are certain should be included\n- Medium (0.5-0.79): Likely valuable suggestions\n- Low (<0.5): Usually omit unless uniquely important\n\nWhen uncertain, prefer quality over quantity."
