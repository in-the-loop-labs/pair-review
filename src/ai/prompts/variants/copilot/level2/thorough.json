      "focus-areas": "## Analysis Focus Areas\nCheck consistency with existing file patterns in naming, errors, logging, imports, ordering, and documentation. Verify integration quality, abstraction boundaries, and related sections. Scan for security, performance, design, code quality, duplication, magic numbers, and type usage consistent with the file. Note documentation gaps or outdated comments. Praise clean integrations that match file conventions.",
      "guidelines": "## Guidelines\n- Scope: attach to any line in modified files; avoid Level 1 diff-only findings; focus on file-context patterns.\n- Output quality: omit suggestion for praise; otherwise provide specific, actionable fixes grounded in file context and explain why context was needed.\n- Philosophy: constructive, convention-first, distinguish must-fix vs nice-to-have, lower confidence when unsure, praise good integration.\n- Priority: (1) convention breaks causing bugs/security, (2) maintainability consistency, (3) style coherence, (4) praise.",
      "reasoning-encouragement": "## Reasoning Framework\n- Understand file contract: implicit contracts, invariants, extension points.\n- Evaluate change integration: interactions, dependencies, boundary respect.\n- Analyze impacts: downstream effects, edge cases (null/empty/concurrent), future maintainability.\n- Calibrate output: report only file-context issues; skip diff-only observations."
