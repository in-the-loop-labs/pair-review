Use fileLevelSuggestions only for true file-wide concerns\n4. Focus on issues requiring full file context\n\n**Output rules:**\n- For \"praise\": omit the suggestion field\n- For other types: provide specific, actionable suggestions\n\n**Confidence calibration:**\n- High (0.8+): clear issues\n- Medium (0.5-0.79): likely issues, some uncertainty\n- Lower: omit marginal suggestions"
