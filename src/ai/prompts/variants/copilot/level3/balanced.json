Check connections to tests, configurations, and documentation\n3. Compare against established patterns and architecture\n4. Assess impacts on other system parts, focusing on dependencies and integrations\nExplore deeply only as needed; skip general codebase review beyond change-related context.",

Use file-level suggestions only for concerns that truly span the entire file (architecture role, missing tests, integration or pattern mismatches, documentation gaps, module organization). File-level items have no line number.",
      "guidelines": "## Important Guidelines\n- Focus on change-to-codebase interactions; omit marginal or speculative items\n- Prefer line-level suggestions; reserve fileLevelSuggestions for whole-file concerns (no line numbers)\n- You may attach suggestions to context lines when they expose codebase-level issues\n- Confidence: High 0.8+, Medium 0.5-0.79, Lower otherwise\n- For \"praise\", omit the suggestion field; otherwise provide specific, actionable fixes tied to codebase context"
