Fix chat panel layout issues: file location links now wrap within chat bubbles instead of overflowing, and panel resize constraints are dynamic based on viewport width. In vertical layout, closing the Review panel no longer locks the Chat panel at a fixed width — the per-panel resize handle is restored so the Chat panel can be freely resized.
