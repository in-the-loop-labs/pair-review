Sharpen orchestration prompts to focus on synthesis over revalidation. Replace generic line number guidance with orchestration-specific guidance that preserves analysis results while retaining investigative capability. Remove file-line-counts section and dead code chain. Clean up unused fileLineCountMap parameter threading.
