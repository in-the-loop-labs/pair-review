Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations

- Press `?` to show keyboard shortcuts help overlay
- Press `c c` to copy all comments to clipboard as markdown
- Press `c x` to clear all comments (with confirmation)
- Press `j`/`k` to navigate between AI suggestions
- Press `Enter` to confirm dialogs, `Escape` to cancel

Shortcuts use chord detection (e.g., press `c` then `c` within 500ms) and are disabled when typing in input fields or when modals are open.
