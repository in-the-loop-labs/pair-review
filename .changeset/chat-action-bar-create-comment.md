Add "Create comment" shortcut button and dismiss control to chat action bar

- "Create comment" button appears when chat is opened from a diff line gutter icon, sending structured line metadata to the agent
- Dismiss (×) button on the action bar to hide stale shortcuts mid-conversation
- `chat.enable_shortcuts` config option to globally disable action bar shortcuts
