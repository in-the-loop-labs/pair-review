Add "Chat about lines" action to diff panel gutter and comment forms

- Gutter chat button alongside the existing + comment button, with drag-to-select line range support
- Chat button in line-level and file-level comment forms to pivot unsaved comments into chat
- Line context cards with structured metadata for the chat agent (file, lines, provenance)
- AI suggestion provenance passed through comment context when comments originated from suggestions
- Editing-mode properly hides action buttons on both line-level and file-level comments
